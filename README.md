# neighborhood app
Midterm Project for UI Design Course

## Instructions of assignment:

Create a webpage that lets users interact with data. You must use Flask, HTML, CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript. 
 You may use Bootstrap if you want, but it’s not required. The changes to the data must be saved to the Flask server.
There are three main parts to this assignment that we will be assessing: 
 functionality, usability, and graphic design.
 
The basic functionality of your site must allow the user to:

        ● Create new data
  
        ● View data
  
        ● Delete data
  
        ● Update data
  
        ● Search the data
  
## About:
An application where users can find people in their area/neighborhood that are willing to teach them a skill. They can also post skills to teach others. 
The purpose of this app is to allow people to meet their neighbors in a fun way, especially during a time where meeting people is hard.
